    countryOfOrigin: 'France',
    category: 'red',
    description: 'Malbec or cot is found all along the Pilgrimâ€™s Way from the vineyards of the Loire to those of the southwest and though once important in Bordeaux, is now a marginal variety except in Cahors where it thrives. In its second home of Argentina it has single-handedly put the country on the map.'

    category: 'red',
    description: 'There are many versions of pinot noir, which mutates easily and which growers find exasperatingly difficult to grow successfully. It remains therefore an irresistible challenge to wine-growers as far apart as Oregon, Argentina, New Zealand and Hungary'

    countryOfOrigin: 'Spain',
    category: 'red',
    description: 'At its simplest grenache makes round, heart-warming wines. At its best it has real majesty, making full-bodied wines with a sensation of sweetness due to the amount of alcohol and glycerol. It can become complex and spicy, with flavours reminiscent of rich fruit cake.'
